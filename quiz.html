I've updated your HTML and JavaScript to include the functionality for displaying the correct answer and an explanation when a user selects a wrong answer. I've also integrated the `explanation` fields into your `quizDataJson` for the "Unit 1", "Unit 3", and "Mars Quiz" sections, following the pattern I previously provided for "Unit 2".

Here's the complete, updated code:
